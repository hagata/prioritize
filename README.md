# prioritize


todo,
- move the ui loop in the None match arm into it's on crate mod
- move the actions and their function definitIon into their own mod 

- store the tasks json file somewhere generic on the system
    - allow users to define where the todo/task json file lives ... like dropbox synced dir for example
